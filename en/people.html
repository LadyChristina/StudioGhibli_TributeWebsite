								Hayao Miyazaki <span class="role_name">Co-Founder</span>
							</h2>
							<p>
								Hayao Miyazaki (Japanese: 宮崎 駿 Hepburn: Miyazaki Hayao, born January 5 1941) is a Japanese film director, producer, screenwriter, animator, author, and manga artist. A co-founder of Studio Ghibli, a film and animation studio, he has attained international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of anime feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animation directors.
								<br/>Miyazaki's films usually have common themes among them, including the typical struggle between good and evil, environmentalism, and politics. The protagonists are usually strong, independent girls or young women and the villains are typically uncertain in nature with redeeming qualities.
								<br/>He was announced to retire right after his last feature film, The Wind Rises, but will continue to work on short films.

							<p>
								Toshio Suzuki (鈴木 敏夫Suzuki Toshio, born August 19 1948) is chief producer and co-founder of Studio Ghibli, he was president of Ghibli from 2005 to 2008. Suzuki is renowned as one of Japan's most successful producers after the enormous box office success (in Japan) of many Ghibli films. According to Hayao Miyazaki, "If it were not for Mr. Suzuki, there wouldn't have been Studio Ghibli."
								<br/>Suzuki started out at Tokuma Shoten joining the company shortly after graduating. He worked on Asahi Geino magazen before becoming editor of Animage in 1978, where he met Hayao Miyazaki who had created the Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga. He convinced Miyazaki into turning Nausicaä into a film, co-founding Studio Ghbli after the film. He served on production committees on My Neighbor Totoro and Grave of the Fireflies before officially joining the studio in 1991 as a producer.
								<br/>He graduated from Keio University with a degree in literature.

							<p>
								Isao Takahata (高畑 勲 Takahata Isao, born October 29 1935) is a Japanese film director, animator, screenwriter and producer who has earned critical international acclaim for his work as a director of anime films. Takahata is the co-founder of Studio Ghibli along with long-time collaborative partner Hayao Miyazaki.
								<br/>Graduating from the University of Tokyo with a degree in French literature course in 1959, Takahata joined the newly-created Tōei Dōga animation company (Toei Animation) where a short time later he met Miyazaki, and also directed his first feature film Hols: Prince of the Sun. Ostracized within the company after the financial failure of the film (despite its artistic success), he and Miyazaki left in order to work together, and collaborated on many other films. Unlike most anime directors, Takahata doesn't draw and never worked as an animator before becoming a full fledged director.
								<br/> According to Hayao Miyazaki, "Music and study are his hobbies".

							Yoshifumi Kondō (近藤 喜文 Kondō Yoshifumi, March 31 1950 – January 21 1998) was a Japanese animator who worked for Studio Ghibli in his last years. Kondō directed the animated film Whisper of the Heart, and was expected to become one of the top directors at Studio Ghibli, alongside Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, and to become their eventual successor.<br/>
							Kondō died of aortic dissection in 1998. His death is said to have been caused by excess work, and seems to be the main reason for Hayao Miyazaki's first announcement of retirement in 1998. Although Miyazaki later returned to Studio Ghibli, Kondō's death seems to have influenced Miyazaki to work at a more relaxed pace.
